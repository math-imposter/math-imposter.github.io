<h2>Comparison with <i>Conformal Prediction under Ambiguous Ground Truth</i> (Stutz et al., 2023)</h2>

<p>
The ECDF method proposed by [Stutz’23] was originally developed for a different setting than ours, where they study the problem of uncertainty in the ground truth labels. In their framework, each calibration point consists only of an input \(X_i\); they sample \(m\) labels to get \(m\) p-values for each calibration point, and then take the unweighted average of these p-values. Let us denote this unweighted average as \(P_{\text{avg}}^i\), with distribution function \(F\). Their ECDF method transforms \(P_{\text{avg}}^i\) into a valid p-value via \(F(P_{\text{avg}}^i)\), and the prediction set is then the set of all labels such that the corrected p-value \(F(P_{\text{avg}}^i)\) corresponding to each sample is greater than some threshold \(\alpha\).
</p>

<p>
While the focus of [Stutz’23] is on aggregating p-values across sampled labels, their ECDF transformation is general enough to be applied to the weighted average of p-values as well. This allows us to adapt it to our setting, where each p-value corresponds to a different prediction model or expert. This page presents additional experimental results where we apply the [Stutz’23] ECDF method to recreate the main findings of our paper with their alternative transformation.
</p>

<p>
In their paper, [Stutz’23] note that the coverage guarantee using the true CDF holds only with an asymptotic number of samples, as the empirical CDF \(\widehat{F}\) approaches the true CDF \(F\). To establish a finite-sample guarantee, they introduce a DKW-derived correction \(\epsilon\) and construct the prediction sets based on \(\widehat{F} + \epsilon\). We find that, although their proposed prediction set yields an elegant \((1-\alpha)(1-\delta)\) finite-sample guarantee, the \(\epsilon\) correction is extremely conservative in practice.

<p>
In the experiments below, we refer to the [Stutz’23] finite-sample ECDF method as "ECDF-DKW", and the variant without the DKW correction as simply "ECDF".

    Figure 1: This figure recreates the regression experiments from Figure 2 of our submission, with the addition of the ECDF and ECDF-DKW methods of [Stutz’23]. We note that the ECDF method performs very similarly to our WA precise method in terms of coverage, WS coverage, and prediction set size. (Left column) like WA precise, the ECDF method's marginal coverage is more conservative than split conformal, but less conservative than the WA targeted methods. (Center column) however, ECDF enjoys better WS coverage than split conformal, although it still often falls short of the \(1-\alpha\) guarantee on the WS slab. Meanwhile, ECDF-DKW is so conservative that, due to limited calibration data in the UCI datasets, its prediction sets cover the entire label space. We represent this with 100% coverage on both the coverage (left) and WS coverage (center) plots, and we do not plot the ECDF-DKW prediction set sizes (right column).

    Figure 2: This figure recreates the Communities and Crimes experiment from Figure 7 of our submission, with the addition of the ECDF and ECDF-DKW methods of [Stutz’23]. Just as the ECDF method performs similarly to the WA precise method on the Communities dataset of Figure 1, it also performs similarly to WA precise when we take a demographic-conditional view of Communities, with similar coverage and prediction set size. Once again, the ECDF-DKW is so conservative that it has 100% coverage with unbounded prediction sets.

  Why is the finite-sample ECDF variant so conservative?

<p>
In this section, we examine why the finite-sample ECDF variant, ECDF-DKW, is so conservative.
</p>

<p>
Recall that [Stutz'23] use DKW to add a finite-sample adjustment \(\epsilon\) to the empirical CDF \(\widehat{F}(P_{\text{all}})\), and then compare this sum to the significance level \(\alpha\). The prediction set with finite-sample guarantees is therefore the set of all labels such that \(\widehat{F}(P_{\text{avg}}) + \epsilon > \alpha\). However, if \(\epsilon\) is already greater than \(\alpha\), then this condition is always satisfied and the prediction set includes <i>all</i> labels, becoming unbounded.
</p>

<p>
The finite-sample adjustment \(\epsilon\) is a function of the number of samples used to compute the empirical CDF. As shown below, when the merge set size is less than 1000, \(\epsilon\) is typically large enough to exceed common values of \(\alpha\), making unbounded sets very likely.
</p>

  <p>
    Figure 3: This plot shows how the finite-sample adjustment \(\epsilon\) changes with the number of samples used to compute the empirical CDF, \(|S_{\text{merge}}|\), and the user-selected significance level \(\delta\). In [Stutz'23], \(\epsilon\) is the offset required to ensure a finite sample guarantee of \((1-\alpha)(1-\delta)\). Dashed lines represent \(\alpha\) levels of 0.05 and 0.1. When \(\epsilon > \alpha\), the prediction set becomes unbounded, including all labels and yielding 100% coverage.
